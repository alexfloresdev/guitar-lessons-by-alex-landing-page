           <li>... do you fall off track in reaching your goals and wish you had more accountability?</li>

            <ul>
                <li>There are people who know how to help you <strong>define your goals</strong> and create <strong>customized action plans</strong> to reach those goals quickly (they're called <strong>Coaches</strong>)</li>
                
                <li>There are individuals who know how to take generalized vaguely helpful information and turn it into a <strong>structured and systematic series of lessons</strong> that result in <em>transformation</em> for the student who applies these lessons (they're called <strong>Teachers</strong>)</li>
                <li>And if you take <strong>guitar lessons with Alex</strong>, you will get both a <strong><em>dedicated coach</em></strong> AND a <strong><em>skilled teacher</em></strong> who will get you where you want to go as fast as you can handle</li>

            <p>By clicking the button below you will get Alex's  first and maybe most important lesson of all: <strong>"The Getting Clear on your Goals Lesson"</strong></p>
            
            <p>You'd be stunned by how many devoted guitarists <strong>never</strong> actually think about what they want to accomplish and then wonder why their skills aren't where they want them to be.</p>
           
            <p>This lesson, in the form of a survey, is designed to ask you the tough questions now so you're not spinning your wheels later.  It won't be quick or easy but if you give it your best, by the end you will have <strong>officially begun </strong> the process of getting clear on what you want to accomplish.</p>

                It's almost been a whole school year since my daughter had been taking Ukulele lesson from Alex Flores. Our experience with Alex has been a positive one from the very beginning. When we were having trouble with our schedule, he was willing to accommodate us by starting a class on a day that fits our schedule. He is very organized with both class work and homework: every week, I get a recording what was done in class, as well as a list of homework that my daughter is to work on at home. As a parent, I especially appreciate the email that Alex sends out every week to update me on my daughter's progress. I have seen significant improvement on her ability to play various pieces in a short time. When I asked my daughter what she likes about her Ukulele lessons with Mr. Alex, she said, "He makes it fun for us to learn." I'm glad we met Alex as my daughter's Ukulele instructor
